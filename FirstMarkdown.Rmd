# Fencing

In line fencing with a back tick `to show anything in plain text with *no* formatting` which can be useful for many things. 

In line execution of r inside the back ticks by inserting r as the first element `r 3 + pi`

In line execution of r inside the back ticks by inserting r as the first element `3 + pi`

3 back ticks for a whole section of plain text

```
Everything in here as plaintext. 
Even single lines. 

Useful especially when showing other coding intructions

# LaTeX code for equations

We set off equations with `$` for brackets. 

## In-line equations

These equations such as $a = 3 + 4$ will appear inside of a single line of text. 

These equations such as $$a = 3 + 4$$ will appear in a separate line of text.

## Supscripts

$$H_0 = Z_{a + b}$$

## Superscripts

$$S = cA^z$$

Elements can be coupled and nested

$$S = cA^z_1 + z_{2 + x}$$

## Fractions and Greek symbols

$$\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\delta + \gamma_x}$$

## Summation signs

$$Z = \sum_{i=1}^X{k}$$

## Escape the backslash with a custom term 

$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

## Rendering plaintext in a LaTeX equation

$$P(Occurance of Species A) = Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Occurance of Species A}) = Z$$

```{r,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
# Don't forget to start with comments!
# Preliminaries 
library(ggplot2)

pred <- 1:10 # vector of 10 integers 
res <- runif(10) # random uniform values

#print the random numbers 
print(res)

# plot the graph
qplot (x=pred,y=res)
```
Now back to wirting text in our markdown document, including LaTeX equations if we need them such as $a + b$ inserted in the middle of my sentence
